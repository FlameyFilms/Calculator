# Calculator

Here we will be building a graphical calculator. Similar to the one that comes with Windows. We will continue developing in C#.
Here is a great tutorial to develope your first graphical application in C#. It discusses the IDE setup. Read through this slowly
and give it a try. Make sure to understand it and not just do what the pictures say. Let me know when you have finished. You do not
need to upload any code here for this one. Just go have some fun working with the app. Read through it and work through the tutorial
a few times until it is crystal clear!

Lets get back into things!
